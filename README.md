# kepr_plot

Visualize KEPR (kinetic electron paramagnetic resonance) data with PGFPlots & TikZ.

## Compilation

Compile the document ``main.tex`` with XeLaTeX using MikTeX. When visualizing many line plots it may be necessary to 
expand the main memory size with the additional compiler argument ``--extra-mem-top=100000000``.

## Experimental Data

This work contains example KEPR data acquired during a practical in the directory ``data``. The files also include the corresponding fits and residuals.
- ``esr_daten-6_kepr.txt``: _tert_-Butylperoxyl radical generated by the photolysis of
2,2,4,4-tetramethyl-3-pentanone in _tert_-butylbenzene.
- ``esr_daten-7_kepr.txt``: Stannyloxy nitroxide generated through two reaction pathways: 
2-methyl-2-nitropropane and bis(tributyltin) (A), 2-methyl-2-nitropropane, tributyltinhydride 
and di-_tert_-butylperoxide (B).
